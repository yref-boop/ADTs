# ADTs
programming II lab practicals 

organized each practical on each p folder
- p0: abstract implementation of rational numbers

BIDFIC: online auction website -> must store all information asocciated with the products
- p1: implementation of datatypes and a static (array) and singly-linked dynamic list
- p2: new features are added: a bid stack will be associated to each product, thus:
  - an ordered list (ADT ProductList) stores the auctioned products
  - a stack (ADT BidStack) stores the bids made for each product
the code must be changed to implement this as well as a new operation Award on main
